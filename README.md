Information for Ashes2007's automatic file backup program.
This is a highly configurable software for saving youe work. 
The system is currently in the V(0.56) state.
You can either leave it running always, or you can open it periodically, and it will automatically check for any needed actions and run them.
	Current functions:
Saving files based on time.
Deleting old backup files.
Configurable.
	WIP functions:
Log reading/ log printing (Broken due to recent change, contact me on github or discord for a workaround)
Multiple user configuration ability (Should work, just not tested)
	Next version's functions:
Backing up multiple source directories at once!
Sending backed up files to a dated .ZIP periodically
Background running (Functional with slight tweak tweak)
Github updater?
	How to install:
Simply double click the included .exe, and it will install itself. This takes a few milliseconds, and will have to be repeated for each user.
	How to use:
Click the included .exe, and follow the onscreen instructions. There are a few things that will harmlessly shut down the program immediately. Basically don't press enter with a blank screen. (This will be fixed in V0.56)
	How to uninstall:
1:1) Contact me on discord for the uninstaller (Couldn't be included due to complications)
	Option 2:
2:1) Type "regedit" into the search bar and open registry editor.
2:2) Type "Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Backupsystemprefs" into the bar on the top of the registry editor (without quotes)
2:3) Right click "Backupsystemprefs" and click delete.
2:4) Delete the parent folder of this .txt
